This is an R markdown document. It combines text and code so that you can write
reports, dashboards, slidedecks etc. They are also really useful for 
capturing the analytical thought process behind your work.

## Gapminder
Here's a visualization of the Gapminder data that the Swedish statistician
and sword-swallower Hans Rosling made famous in a beautiful data visualisation
showing how country's GDP per capita and life expectancy were related as a 
function of time (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo).
He showed that generally countries are improving, but
notably that the African and Asian continents were catching up with the so-called
"developed" countries.

Click on the green arrows to the right of the shaded boxes to run the code and
produce the Gapminder graphic (it takes a moment or two for the code  to run).

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
library(gganimate)
```


```{r, message=FALSE, results="hide", cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

### All countries
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("myGapminderPlot.gif")
```

### Comparing countries

We can repeat this visualisation and pick out the results for a single, given
country and compare with the others using the following code.

In R we assign values to objects using the `<-` character, so
  
`objectName <- value`
  
The `<-` symbol can be read (say it in your head) as "gets" or alternatively
(from right to left) `value` "is assigned to" `objectName`.

The `<-` symbol is a legacy from programming languages (and hardware!)... 
It *is* possible to use `=`, but I suggest you *don't*, for sake of clarity and 
consistency. I'll discuss why over coffee... 

Anyway, change the code below where it says `myCountry <- "United Kingdom"` to select 
one of the countries listed below:  
  
  `r glue::glue_collapse(sort(unique(as.character(gapminder::gapminder$country))), sep = ", ")`
  
***WATCH OUT*** for spelling, and note that R is case-sensitive, so that "United Kingdom"
is not the same as "united kingdom".

If you're feeling adventurous, you could provide more than one country. To do
this, use the `c( )` function to provide the names of more than one country. 
Separate countries using a comma, and don't forget to put the country names in
double quotes.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide", cache=TRUE}
library(gghighlight)

myCountry <- "United Kingdom"

myGapminderPlot2 <- gapminder %>%
  ggplot( aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear') +
  # Here we select the country to highlight
  gghighlight(country %in% myCountry, use_direct_label = FALSE)

anim_save("myGapminderPlot2.gif", myGapminderPlot2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("myGapminderPlot2.gif")
```
